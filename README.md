  * Use ChatGPT to help you code further. The code was a mess when I took the torch, and it's only a bit less of a mess when I stepped down due to nolanritchie returning for a short time to update some code. So do your part, use AI to assist your coding. ChatGPT is free to use, and can help you with literally anything LUA, and if you specify project zomboid, it can help you even more. if it doesn't know something? Copy code to it and show it an example of code. Honestly I wish I had ChatGPT when I was messing with the mod.
