The start of EXP 17 has started. It's at a point where we're unsure if it's safe to update to the workshop but enough to give a try on github
Please provide bug reports / feedback on the steamgroup or discord!


## The start of EXP 17 - U1
- Started to work on the Guard Job: Guards should be smart enough to not 'let their guard down' for when enemies are near
- A new 'TempGuard' area started. In future EXP updates, you will be able to create a secondary guard area. 
- FIX: 'Select area' will not reset when you're trying to click on 'SET' (Need more feedback)


## EXP 17 - U2
* Update to the follower job to run if at least hurt
* Added a attempt-failsafe to the infamous 'crash while asleep' bug
* Fixed the infamous 'Select area reset' bug
* Progress to the guard job to be a little smarter in combat and knowing where the guard area you set is at (otherwise the guard will goto your base zone)

## EXP 17 - U3
* cleaned up leftover code that was previously tested with
* NPCs should be able to flee from danger more properly

* Rare bug: there is a chance follower job will still stand there trying to heal. HOWEVER, they will still run away from danger. Allow your follow distance to be big enough to allow the NPC to have enough personal space.

## EXP 17 - U4
* Fixed as close as possible on NPCs running away from danger. 
* Bits of improvement towards movement management.

## EXP 17 - U5
* The player will now post a message above their head every 1 minute, if they are trying to use an unsupported mod (The mod name will display too)
* removed farming order since it no longer works (I genuinely tried making it work too)
* added speech text to npcs when they're heading away to get food/water
* Removed some weapons that always lead the NPC to be frozen when used
* Follower job Improvements


Do not fret, I am aware of the post in the steam group about farming. I do not have the time to add that code right now but I will look into it.
