Update 14 Experimental 

- Survivor Bravery is now included on combat tasks. Will it help? It seems like the NPCs won't run away always after first hit. At least with my testing.

- Pursue Task Update: I brought it back, I believe I figured out how to keep it working too. Now the hostile NPCs will not magically forget where you are 
within a short range. But if they are on your tail, they're going to try to find you, and they're going to be better at it. (That's the hopeful idea anyways.)

- Walking/Running: Added a new function to assist the NPCs to run or walk to their targets. This is to assist further on fixing the issues where
the NPCs run into the main player or into each other, or pushing you into a horde of zombies. 

- Guns Update: NPCs be a bit better with guns. Especially the hostile NPCs. The hostile NPCs currently will not goto to you to threaten you, then run off
to reload and then fight you. The NPCs will now prepare for battle like they should. This wasn't easy to get going, but so far things are looking good, 
and the NPCs are mostly doing what they're supposed to.

The NPCs on Pursue task / Threaten task, when very far away, they are currently walking, when they should be running. This is currently a known bug
and I'll be working on that later too. But for now, here you go (to anyone that reads this.)

Update 14 Experimental - 2nd upload

- Guns: NPCs should now be even better with using guns as they were previously than last upload. 
The NPCs will run away though once they have realized they don't have ammo or sense they are in danger for the most part. 
So this would include your player groups. The NPCs will try to keep their own life in tact. (or try to anyways.)

- Bravery: Forgot about this, but I adjusted the 'Very brave' option. Instead of it being 4 points of bravery, it's now 50. 
I have no idea how this will effect the NPCs. It may do nothing at all, or it may break everything else.
